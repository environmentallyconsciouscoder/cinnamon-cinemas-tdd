# Cinnamon Cinemas Exercise

## Project description

In the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), users can request between 1 to 3 tickets through the booking system, which will subsequently check the availability of seats and allocate them to the user. The allocation process follows a sequence starting from row A to C, moving from left to right.

There are a total of 15 seats available, with 5 seats in each row. There are three rows labeled from A to C. The future roadmap includes plans to adjust the number of seats and rows to accommodate different cinema setups.

## Installation

Please ensure that you have Java and Maven installed on your computer. To run the unit tests, use the command 'mvn test'.
